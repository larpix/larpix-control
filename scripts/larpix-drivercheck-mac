Once the .dmg is downloaded, open it up and run the installer. You will
likely have to restart your computer before the driver will load
correctly. You will know it works when, after plugging in an FTDI device
(e.g. the FPGA board), you see at least one "file" named something like

cu.usbserial-xxxxxxx

in the /dev directory of your computer. You can check for this by
yourself or by running the larpix-find-device-mac command.\
